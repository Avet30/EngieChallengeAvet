Welcome to my EngieChallenge Solution.

1) To run the project locally using Visual Studio : 

Just Build and Run "EngieChallenge.API", which is the default option for launching the APP. 
This will open a localhost on port 8888 so you can try it out.

2) To run in a docker container, select "Docker" in the list of launch options instead of "EngieChallenge.API" in visual studio. 
You will need Docker Desktop for this to work.
This will open a container so you can try out the project.
